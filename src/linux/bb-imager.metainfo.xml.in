  <description>
    <p>
      BeagleBoard Imager downloads a .JSON file from the BeagleBoard
      website with a list of all current download options, ensuring you are
      always installing the most up-to-date version.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’ve selected an operating system from the available options,
      the utility reads the relevant file directly from the BeagleBoard
      website and writes it straight to the SD card. This speeds up the
      process quite considerably compared to the standard process of reading
      it from the website, writing it to a file on your hard drive, and then,
      as a separate step, reading it back from the hard drive and writing it
      to the SD card.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this process, BeagleBoard Imager also caches the downloaded
      operating system image – that is to say, it saves a local copy on your
      computer, so you can program additional SD cards without having to
      download the file again.
